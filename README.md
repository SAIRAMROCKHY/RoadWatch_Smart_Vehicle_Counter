# RoadWatch : Smart Vehicle Counter

This project implements vehicle detection and counting using OpenCV, a popular computer vision library in Python. The system analyzes video frames to identify vehicles, draws bounding boxes around them, and counts the number of vehicles passing through a specified area.
 
# Practical Applications

  - Traffic Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of traffic flow to analyze congestion, optimize traffic signals, and improve road management.
  - Environmental Monitoring: Tracking vehicle movements to assess air pollution levels and reduce emissions.
  - Security and Surveillance: Enhancing security measures by identifying and tracking vehicles in restricted areas.

# Key Components

  - OpenCV: A powerful library for image and video processing, providing tools for object detection, contour analysis, and more.
  - Python: Programming language used for implementing image processing algorithms and integrating with OpenCV.

# How It Works
  1. Frame Difference: Compute the absolute difference between consecutive frames to detect moving objects.
  2. Image Processing: Convert frames to grayscale, apply Gaussian blur, and perform thresholding to isolate vehicle features.
  3. Object Detection: Identify vehicle contours using morphological operations and draw bounding boxes around detected vehicles.
  4. Counting Logic: Track vehicles crossing a designated line in the frame and update the count accordingly.

# Getting Started

  1. Install OpenCV in your Python environment: 
     - pip install opencv-python
  2. Clone or download this repository:
     - git clone https://github.com/your-username/Vehicle-Detection-and-Counting.git
  3. Run the vehicle_detection.py script with your video file:
     - python vehicle_detection.py --video Video.mp4
